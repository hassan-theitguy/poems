@Drums of hope

When the day comes
The Earth drums
Mankind wakes up
Coffee in the cup
Life dances away
Things will be okay

@Beautiful Mind

Thinking out loud
Lost in a crowd
Bright like a light
On a dark night
Found in my head
With words I said

@Odd nights

One of these nights
I put on the lights
Blessings from above
I can feel the love
Pouring like rain
Enough to sustain

@The Brave Kite

Watching over us
Never making a fuss
Through ups and downs
Standing our grounds
Leading with ease
Life is a breeze

@Give thanks

I wake up today
Give thanks and pray
Food in a plateful
I am grateful
I face what will be
Create a better me

@A new day

Thanks I give
One life to live
Enjoy the now
Take a bow
Break from strife
Cheers for life

@When the rains came

Roofs became a rhythm section
Clouds staged an insurrection
Putting the sun's scorch on pause
With thunderous applause
Pretty flowers started smiling
Winding to strikes of lightning

@POETRY

Power of words
Of lyrical nerds
Emotions in rhyme
Test of time
Rhythm in mind
You are unwind

@Unity

All of our hands
As grains of sands
Together as one
Better than none

Give conflict a rest

@Dear Friend

I see that you are trying
Your footprints I am following
Through the highs and lows
Only the Almighty knows
My esteem does not end
Thanks for being my friend

@Inner Voice

No words to say
But I could pray
I could not talk
But I could walk
My lips were tight
But I could write

@Dear Sunshine

You make me smile
I walk a mile
Time after time
Love so sublime
Worries unwind
All in my mind

@Wandering Soul

I saw the distance, vast and wide
I felt the thrill, deep inside
I smelt the scent of nature's bloom
I heard the whisper in the gloom
I tasted joy upon my tongue
I embarked on a journey, forever young

One day at a time
This mountain I climb
To be able I pray
He leads the way
I may stumble
I stay humble

@A river of clocks

Drop by drop, time goes by
How many seconds can we buy?
Where does this river go?
We just go with the flow

This is what I have solely

@What if

What if there was no illness
No wars but only chillness
There was no hate
And no borders to separate
Everyone had riches
With millions of wishes

Never stop
Today is done
Tomorrow soon come

Flowered curtains sway
Bouncing dogs bark
On my way to the park

My words I gave
Said a prayer
My heart I share

Move on after we fall
